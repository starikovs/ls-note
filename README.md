# Welcome to LS Note!

**LS** stands for your notes being stored directly in your browser's **local storage**.

## What’s cool about it?

This is a simple, offline-first, note-taking app that lives right in your browser.

It’s perfect for quick edits when you don’t want to clutter up your main notes app with temporary stuff. Your notes are saved locally in your browser’s storage — no internet required. Even if you're offline, you can still edit your notes.

And yes, you can only edit notes in plain text.

## Why plain text?

Because plain text is awesome — no formatting, no fuss.

Ever tried quickly editing something, hoping to have it copy-pasted in plain text, but ended up with annoying formatting? Then you’re stuck Googling hotkeys to paste as plain text. On macOS, it’s an acrobatic combo: `Option+Shift+Command+V`. On mobile, it’s not straightforward either. What a hassle.

With this app, you can relax and edit notes in plain text. No drama.
