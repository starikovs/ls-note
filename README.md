# Plain Text Note-Taking, Right in Your Browser

This is a simple, no-nonsense, secure note-taking app that lives in your browser.

Perfect for those quick edits when you don’t want to clutter up your main notes app with temporary stuff. Your notes are saved locally in your browser’s storage — no internet involved.

## Why in plain text?

Because plain text is awesome — no formatting, no fuss.

Ever tried to quickly edit something only to have it copy-pasted with annoying formatting? Then you’re stuck Googling hotkeys to paste as plain text. On macOS, it’s an acrobatic combo: Option+Shift+Command+V. What a hassle.

This app lets you chill and edit in plain text, no drama.
