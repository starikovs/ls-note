# In-browser plain text note-taking app

This is a minimalist and secure in-browser plain text note-taking app.

Use it when you want to quick edit something in plain text without cluttering your main Note app with temp notes. Notes are saved in your browser's local storage.

## Why in plain text?

Because plain text is cool, and it has no formatting :)

Sometimes I want to quickly edit something in plain text, I copy some text, I paste it, I get text pasted with formatting,
then I google a hotkey of how to paste as plain text in my current OS or mobile device. On macOS you even have to do some gymnastics
with your fingers to paste a plain text `Option+Shift+Command+V`.. And it's a pain.

This is a place when you can relax and edit something in plain text.
