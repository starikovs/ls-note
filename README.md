# Welcome to LS Note!

**LS** means your notes are stored directly in your browser's **local storage**.

## What’s cool about it?

This is a simple, offline first, note-taking app that lives in your browser.

Perfect for those quick edits when you don’t want to clutter up your main notes app with temporary stuff. Your notes are saved locally in your browser’s storage — no internet involved. Even if you're offline, you can still edit notes.

And yeah, you can edit notes only in plain text...

## Why in plain text?

Because plain text is awesome — no formatting, no fuss.

Ever tried to quickly edit something only to have it copy-pasted with annoying formatting? Then you’re stuck Googling hotkeys to paste as plain text. On macOS, it’s an acrobatic combo: `Option+Shift+Command+V`. On mobile devices it's not a straightforward way either. What a hassle.

This app lets you chill and edit in plain text, no drama.

## Features

1. Notes are saved in your browser’s local storage
2. No data goes online — your notes stay private
3. No cookies, no trackers
4. Offline first and mobile first
5. Hotkeys for desktop users
6. Remembers your caret position (desktop)
7. Dark and light mode adjust to your system settings
